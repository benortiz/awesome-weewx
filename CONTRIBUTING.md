## Code of conduct

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Keep in mind this is an **awesome** list, not any piece of software you find
- All links must be relevant, tested and well described
- Categories should follow the weewx's architecture as close as possible. Add
  subcategories if necesary.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a Pull Request adhere to the standards above can be
difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll
ask you to edit your Pull Request before we merge it. There's no need to open
a new Pull Request, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do
that, [here is a guide][amending] on the different ways you can update your
Pull Request so that we can merge it.
